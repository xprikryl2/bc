## ca-bundle.crt -- Bundle of CA Root Certificates
##
## Converted at: 10.02.2016 11:46:56
##
## This is a bundle of X.509 certificates of public Certificate Authorities
## (CA). These were automatically extracted from Mozilla's root certificates
## file (certdata.txt).  This file can be found in the mozilla source tree:
## '/mozilla/source/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt'
##
## It contains the certificates in PEM format and therefore
## can be directly used with curl / libcurl / php_curl, or with
## an Apache+mod_ssl webserver for SSL client authentication.
## Just configure this file as the SSLCACertificateFile.
